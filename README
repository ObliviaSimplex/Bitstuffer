Bitstuffer is a simple command-line utility whose sole purpose is
stuffing 1-bits into a bitstream at specified intervals, and
unstuffing those same bits (or other bits, should the user desire). It
can read input both from files and from stdin, making it easy to chain
two or more instances of Bitstuffer together.

This feature makes it easy to test the Bitstuffer's fidelity. The Unix
command

./bitstuffer -sqcp 5 -f sample.txt | ./bitstuffer -uqcp 5 -f -

will load sample.txt into memory as a byte array, bit-stuff (-s) that
bytearray by inserting a 1-bit at 5-bit intervals (as specified by the
option -p 5), and then output the result as raw bytes (using the %c
format string specifier, as specified by -c). This will then pass
through a Unix pipe to the second instance of bitstuffer, which has
been instructed to unstuff (-u) the input that it reads from stdin (-f
-), which is returns in raw byte format (as characters). Verbose
output has been turned off for each instance with the -q flag. If you
want to take a look at this output, you can switch it on with -v, and
it will be sent to stderr (so as not to clog the pipe). But it really
is *quite* verbose, and so is not recommended unless the input size is
quite small. For something like

echo hello | ./bitstuffer -svcp 5 -f - | ./bitstuff uvcp 5 -f -

it may be interesting to look at, as it includes a display of the
bitstream and highlighting of the stuffed bits.

Bitstuffer writes to stdout by default. If you want to write a
bitstuffed bytearray to a file, the best way is to just use output
redirection, like so

./bitstuffer -svcp 5 -f sample.txt > sample.stf

Bitstuffer can also output its bytearrays in hexidecimal and binary
notation. To achieve this, try

./bitstuffer -sqxp 5 -f sample.txt

for hex, or

./bitstuffer -sqbp 5 -f sample.txt

for binary notation.

Many of these command line options have default settings, for ease of
use (for example, Bitstuffer expects input from stdin, unless told
otherwise). For details, run ./bitstuffer -h.

To compile
----------
gcc bitstuffer.c -o bitstuffer
